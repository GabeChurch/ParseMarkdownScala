Simplified Markdown Parser for Scala/Java/Play
=============


This package simplifies the [flexmark java markdown parser](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java), which allows you to parse different flavors of markdown (CommonMark, Kramdown, Multimarkdown, Classic Markdown) to html for direct use in scala or java applications. 

The primary use case for this package is within the play 2.6 framework for parsing markdown documents or text to html either as an output from our application or as an input to our page design. We do not need all of the functionality provided in the flexmark java package but do need easily applied parsing functions within play templates.
